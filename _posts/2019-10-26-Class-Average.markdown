In this paper, I argue that the release of cohort-specific class averages through the Examplify<sup>TM</sup> scoring reports do not adequately encourage development of the Scholar role within the CanMEDS framework. Specifically, I argue that the release of cohort-specific class averages in their current format encourages students to focus on more individual metrics, thus dissuading students from participating in more collaborative efforts to generate collective improvements in practice.

Keywords: CanMEDS, scholar role, medical school, class average, academic performance
